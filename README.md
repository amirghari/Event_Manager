# Earth - Event Manager

Welcome to Earth, an Event Manager application designed to bridge the gap between human beings and mother nature. Our platform facilitates the creation and participation in outdoor events such as hiking, camping, and other nature-related activities. By fostering a community that values and engages with the natural world, we aim to strengthen the bond between individuals and the environment. Our application ensures a responsive web design, making it accessible and easily navigable on a variety of devices, enhancing the user experience.

## Application Overview

Earth is comprised of two primary sections: the Main Page and the Application Page.

- **Main Page:** A welcoming entry point that provides users with an overview of what Earth offers.
- **Application Page:** After registration and login, users can join events created by others or create their own events for the community to enjoy.

### Getting Started

To fully engage with Earth, users are required to:

1. **Register:** Sign up to create an account.
2. **Login:** Access your account to join or create events.

### Technology Stack

This application is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React + Vite, styled using Chakra UI for a sleek and modern look.
- **Backend:** Express with TypeScript, ensuring efficient backend operations.
- **Database:** MongoDB, providing a scalable and relational database solution for storing event data.
- **Testing:** Backend logic is verified with Jest to maintain high-quality code.
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins orchestrates our continuous integration and delivery pipeline, enhancing our development workflow.
