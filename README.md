# Earth - Event Manager

Welcome to Earth, an Event Manager application designed to bridge the gap between human beings and mother nature. Our platform facilitates the creation and participation in outdoor events such as hiking, camping, and other nature-related activities. By fostering a community that values and engages with the natural world, we aim to strengthen the bond between individuals and the environment.

## Application Overview

- **Main Page:** A welcoming entry point that provides users with an overview of what Earth offers.
- **Application Page:** After registration and login, users can join events created by other users or create their own events for the community to enjoy.
