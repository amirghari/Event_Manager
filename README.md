# Earth - Event Manager

Welcome to Earth, the Event Manager application dedicated to fostering a deep connection between human beings and mother nature. Our platform serves as a conduit for creating and participating in outdoor events such as hiking, camping, and various other nature-centric activities. By nurturing a community that actively values and engages with the natural world, our mission is to reinforce the bond between individuals and the environment, promoting a healthier planet and lifestyle.

## Application Overview

Earth is structured around two main sections: the Main Page and the Application Page, designed to offer a seamless and engaging user experience.

- **Main Page:** This welcoming entry point provides users with a succinct overview of Earth's offerings, encouraging exploration and participation.
- **Application Page:** After completing the registration and login process, users gain the ability to join existing events or create new ones, inviting the community to partake in unique outdoor experiences.

### Getting Started

Engaging with the Earth platform is simple and straightforward. Users are encouraged to:

1. **Register:** Sign up to create a personal account.
2. **Login:** Log in to your account to either join community events or create your own.

### Technology Stack

Our application leverages a modern technology stack to ensure a responsive, intuitive, and reliable user experience:

- **Frontend:** Developed with React and Vite for a fast, efficient, and scalable user interface.
- **Backend:** Utilizing Express with TypeScript to provide a robust server-side foundation.
- **Styling Framework:** We integrated Chakra UI for its flexible and accessible component library, which greatly enhances the application's visual appeal and user experience.
- **Database:** MongoDB is employed as our database solution, enabling us to manage a relational database structure that effectively supports the dynamic nature of our events and user interactions.

### Created by Group 4

Earth represents a collective endeavor by Group 4 in the Software Engineering Project 1 course at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. This project is born from our shared commitment to environmental stewardship and community engagement.
